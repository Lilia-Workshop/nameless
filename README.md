## Release channels

Our bot *nameless** has three (3) release channels:

- **Stable**: for features that are ready for wide-use. Or that's all we thought.
![GitHub Workflow Status (with event)](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot/nameless.yml?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&label=Stable)

- **Experimental**: for features that needs heavy-testing. But at least it is usable.

- **Cutting-edge**: for features that are committed, but in a lightweight scale of testing.

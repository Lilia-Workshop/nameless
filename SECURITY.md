# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since nameless* is operating on a rolling-release model, therefore we **only** support the latest version, based on the latest commit on GitHub. 

So please make sure you are using the latest version, with the latest code before reporting any issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- If it's a package: Report it to PyPI - https://pypi.org/security/ - so that Dependabot will wake us up :D

- If it's from nameless* itself: [Create an issue](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot/issues/new/choose), and if it is ***urgent***, give me a head-up on Discord (I always go with the handle `@swyrin`)
  - If you can fix it yourself, that is very grateful <3 - Please [make a pull request](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot/pulls) and let me know ASAP!
